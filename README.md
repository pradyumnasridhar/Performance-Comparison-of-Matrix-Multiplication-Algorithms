<font size="12"> Performance comparision of Matrix Multiplication Algorithms</font>

<font size="2">September 2016</font>

# Introduction
A methodical performance comparison of the Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication algorithm against the brute force and divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication approaches. Each algorithm was compared with its parallelized versions, and the performance was tested with and without <b>Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) optimizations</b>. The code for all versions of each algorithm was written in C. A short paper containing the outcomes of the comparison was published at the IEEE Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA) conference.


# Algorithms Used
- Standard inner product based row-col multiplication algorithm (Brute force Method)
- Divide-and-Conquer based multiplication algorithm O(n^3)
Strassen's recursive Divide-and-Conquer algorithm
- Parallelized Divide-and-Conquer multiplication algorithm O(n^3)
- Parallelized Strassen's recursive Divide-and-Conquer algorithm

# SIMD type
This implementation uses [<b>AVX2</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions).
<br>
Note: commented out in code, as it is not portable (uses calls specific to the compiler and hardware architecture).
